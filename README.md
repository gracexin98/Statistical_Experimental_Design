## 1. Introduction
Milk is considered to be one of the healthiest sources of calcium, vitamin D and potassium. It’s also known for having sleep-rich ingredients. As a sleep drink, hot milk is more popular than cold milk. Unlike water, when the milk reaches the boiling point 212.3 degrees Fahrenheit, a thin skin forms over the milk and the milk boils over the pot and stove. Interested in when milk will boil, we intend to examine 3 common factors in the milk boiling experiment. This Milk Boiling Test is thereby a statistical test that simulates the cooking process of milk and it’s intended to help researchers understand how well energy is transferred through different factors. We intend to explore these factors that may affect the boiling time of milk and optimize this process.

## 2. Choice of factors and response
Let the type of milk be factor A, with two levels of interest: fat-free and 2% reduced fat. Let the covering of pan be factor B, with the high level denoting covered pan and the low level denoting uncovered pan. Let stirring of milk be factor C, with the high level denoting stirring and the low level denoting non-stirring. The boiling time of milk is our response variable. Note that we do not consider factors that we know intuitively that directly affect the boiling time of milk, such as stove temperature and amount of milk, which would be trivial to experiment.

## 3. Choice of design model
This experiment uses the replicated 23 factorial design--a design with 3 factors, each with two levels. The order in which the runs are made is random, so it is a completely randomized experiment. The statistical model for a 23 design would include 3 main effects, 3 two-way interaction effects, and 1 three-way interaction effect. The complete model thus contains 23 -1 = 7 effects. We choose this design model because the three main factors (type of milk, cover of pan, and stirring of milk) in our experiment all contain only two levels; and it’s thereby more meaningful to apply a 23 factorial design compared to a 3-factor factorial design. In addition, we choose to replicate this experiment twice since unreplicated design often introduce random errors to the response. By doing a replicated 23 factorial design, the variation of response, or boiling time, would be more likely due to main factors instead of random errors.

## 4. Execution of the experiment
We purchased multiple bottles of the two types of milk: fat-free skim milk and 2% reduced fat milk from Fresh Madison Market. To reduce variation due to brand difference, we purchased all milk from the same brand (KEMPS) with the same sell-by-date. We started the experiment by pouring the milk into a pot and we used the same pot throughout the experiment to avoid variation due to pan material or pan size. We also poured with the same amount of milk (400ml) each time since more milk is likely to increase the boiling time. After pouring the milk, we first preheated the stove to a constant temperature. Then, we put the milk pot onto the stove and waited for the milk to boil. We then recorded the time when milk ultimately boils. After the measurement of each treatment, we used tap water to clean up the pot and waited until it cooled down to room temperature. Throughout the experiment, we varied the factors one at a time, including the type of milk, the cover of pan, and milk stirring. For milk stirring, we stirred the milk for 10 seconds in a 90 second interval. Each treatment combination was conducted twice.

## 5. Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis Testing: 
The project aims to find out whether the three listed factors have significant effects on the boiling time of milk.

## 6. Conclusion
In conclusion, the ANOVA table shows that all three main factors have significant effects on the boiling time of milk and thereby we reject all null hypothesis for main effects. The linear regression model, on the other side, identifies specifically which level of factor increases or decreases the boiling time. For factor A, fat-free skim milk requires significantly longer boiling time than 2% reduced fat milk. For factor B, boiling milk without cover requires longer boiling time compared to boiling milk with cover. For factor C, stirring milk increases boiling time compared to no stirring. The small p-value for factor A implies that the type of milk is the most important factor that affects the boiling time among the three.
Our experiment is strong as it fits well with the replicated 2k factorial model. 2k model is very useful for identifying significant factors and their interactions and also helps weeding out unimportant ones. Effects A, B, C, and A:C are significant in this process. Furthermore, replicated design is strong since the difference between observations is more likely due to effects rather than random errors compared to un-replicated design.
However, the 2k factorial model only contains 2 levels for each factor, so the statistical analysis might be limited by the number of levels. For instance, the project only includes two types of milk: fat-free skim milk and 2% reduced fat milk. A full factorial design is needed if we extend this factor to more than two levels.
